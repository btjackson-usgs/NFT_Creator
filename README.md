Creating an NFT (eth)

The majority of NFTs reside on the Ethereum cryptocurrency's blockchain. So, we'll do that first and the not yet so popular Solana next. Then we'll run our own blockchain with truffle. We will break the NFT until small units and turn our blockchain into a hard-drive. This is a great model to demonstrate te model discussed for creating Blockchain ENT.

Three methods (may do all three)
------------------------------------------------
First, you can store the information on-chain. In other word, you can extend your ERC-721 and store the metadata on the blockchain, which can be costly.

The second method is to use IPFS. And the third way is to simply have your API return the JSON file.

The first and second methods are usually preferred, since you cannot temper the underlying JSON file. For the scope of this project, we will opt for the third method.
